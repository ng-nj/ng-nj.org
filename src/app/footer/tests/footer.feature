  Feature: The Footer has some hardcoded text.
    In order to see copyright information and terms of user links
    As a user of the website
    I want to have to see copyright information and terms of user links displayed on the screen.

     - Johnny Bibblestein from the Texas Ranger Motorcycle Squad
       alerted me that the footer is quite an important piece of the project
       and surely requires low level step definition acceptance tests!

    Scenario Outline: Copyright text shows
      Given I land on the home page
      When The page loads
      Then the footer should contain the text, <myText>

      Examples:
      | myText|
      | "Copyright 2016 WoJ" |
