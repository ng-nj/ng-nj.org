Official NG-NJ Yeoman Generator: Gulp-Angular<h2>Custom Directives</h2>Custom Directives allow you to put new commands on your HTML tags so you can break up your HTML into reusable components.<h2>Backend</h2>The official server side scripting language for NG-NJ is NodeJS. Firebase - Great for prototyping and making fully functional applications <i>fast.</i> MEAN Stack - This is a common backend setup that uses NodeJS and MongoDB. Loopback / Strongloop - allows you to write one query language and easily swap out different databases.<h2>UI Frameworks</h2>Angular Material - Official Angular ui from Google. Follows Google\\'s Material Design specifications. Also includes a flexbox layout structure. Bootstrap - Classic framework for laying out a page on different screen sizes and includes some cool icons.<h2>Unit Testing</h2>Our suggested generator Gulp-Angular uses karma and jasmine for unit tests (gulp test) and protractor (gulp test:e2e).<h2>Fiddles</h2><h1>Filters></h1>On this page you can find AngularJS code and examples from past events.<div>If you would like to suggest a link to be added to this page, <a>please submit a request here</a>.</div></div></div>\");\n$templateCache.put(\"app/routes/events/events.html\",\"<div layout=\\\"vertical\\\" layout-fill=\\\"\\\"><md-content class=\\\"video-container\\\"><div class=\\\"md-whiteframe-z1 frame-padding events-page\\\"><div class=\\\"header-text-events\\\"><h1>Current Events</h1>Upcoming Angular Events In and Around New Jersey:</div></div><div ng-repeat=\\\"upcomingEvent in ctrl.upcomingEvents\\\" class=\\\"event-section md-whiteframe-z1\\\"><h3 class=\\\"card-title\\\"><span ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.title\\\"></span></h3><div class=\\\"date-text\\\">Date: <span ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.date\\\"></span></div><div class=\\\"details-block\\\"><div>Location: <span class=\\\"value-highlight\\\" ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.location\\\"></span></div><div>Cost: <span class=\\\"value-highlight\\\" ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.cost\\\"></span></div><div>Hosted by: <span class=\\\"value-highlight\\\" ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.hoster\\\"></span></div><div>startTime: <span ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.startTime\\\"></span></div><div>endTime: <span ng-bind=\\\"upcomingEvent.endTime\\\"></span></div></div><a href=\\\"{{upcomingEvent.eventLink}}\\\"><md-button class=\\\"visit-now-btn md-primary md-raised\\\" md-no-ink=\\\"\\\">Visit Now</md-button></a></div></md-content></div>\");\n$templateCache.put(\"app/routes/forgot-password/forgot-password.html\",\"<div layout=\\\"vertical\\\" layout-fill=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"fogot_password\\\"><div layout=\\\"row\\\" layout-sm=\\\"column\\\" class=\\\"card-container\\\"><div class=\\\"card\\\"><h2 ui-sref=\\\"events\\\" class=\\\"card-header\\\">Oh No!

For information about how to change your preferences, and to unsubscribe from newsletters, marketing messages and email notifications, please see the Choice and Control section, below. If you are a Facebook or Google+ user, and one of your Facebook or Google+ friends registers for a NG-NJ® account, we may let your friends who already are on NG-NJ know that you joined or will suggest to your Facebook or Google+ friend that you might be someone they may wish to follow on NG-NJ. If you are a Facebook or Google+ user and sign up using Facebook or Google+ , we may also use the information we receive about you from Facebook or Google to suggest or connect you to users that you may wish to follow on NG-NJ®. It will be up to you if you choose to follow these users and you can unfollow them at any time. Improving and customizing the Platform and advertising: To analyze the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Website and using the Apps and Services, in order to improve NG-NJ® and customize it to your needs and interests. To show you interesting NG-NJ ads, when you visit third party websites. When you see our ads on a third party website or apps, we or third party services we engage for this purpose, may collect information your browser or mobile app makes available when seeing the ad (e.g. ip-addresses, referral URL, browser details, timestamp of request). Third party websites or apps may also allow us to measure the success of our ads on their websites. This may include e.g. whether a click converted to an actual purchase of a Subscription. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out. To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening, liking or creating playlists), including location data, together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose to make available to us (such as your age or gender) directly or through third party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence, the age range, or the number of followers of an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider. When we engage third party services such as ad-networks that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. If you allow third party websites to collect and share data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out. To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time. For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the proposed use of your personal data. Sharing of your information We will not share your information with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including our Cookies Policy). There are circumstances where we may need to share some of the information we collect about you or which you provide to us - these circumstances are as follows: Other users: Any information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. If you listen to any sounds uploaded by a pro user, the fact that you have listened to those sounds will be shared with that pro user as well as that you are following that pro user now, so that they can track the popularity of their sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform. With your consent: We will disclose your information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information. Service providers: We use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us. Where we transfer personal data to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us. Users of our API: NG-NJ has an open API, which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into exciting new apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Any information that you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public sounds, may be accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available over the API, please see the Choice and Control section below. Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your NG-NJ® account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, you will be sharing certain information with these apps or networks. In the case of Facebook, Google+, Tumblr or Twitter, any new public sounds that you post or listen to on NG-NJ® or any new favourites will be shared to those networks and will be visible to your followers and friends on those networks. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your NG-NJ® account in order to upload and download sounds, or comment on, favourite or repost sounds from within the app. This will mean sharing your public information, plus access to your private sounds. NG-NJ is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that your share, and how to disconnect your account from other networks or apps, please see the Choice and Control section below. Advertisers may use third party services to ensure their ads are properly served and to measure the success of their campaigns on websites and apps. We allow these services to collect and use the information for such purposes. As aggregated data: We may aggregate your personal data with similar data relating to other users of the Platform in order to create statistical information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with third parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information would include any email address or other contact information, or anything that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real life. If required by law: We will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request. To protect our interests: We may disclose your information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the NG-NJ® community. In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your information to any person or company that acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of NG-NJ, or on a merger of our business, or in the event of our insolvency. Cookies and similar technology In common with most websites, we use cookies and other standard Internet technologies to help us improve the Website and the Apps and Services we provide. We have included information about our use of cookies and similar technology in a separate Cookies Policy that forms part of this Privacy Policy. The Cookies Policy also includes information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform), and how to opt out of other technologies such as bug reporting within our mobile apps. Ads displayed to you are in some cases provided by third parties. These may and as far as allowed by your settings or your device, use information about your visit and interaction with the Platform in order to show you personalized ads of products and services that may be of interest to you. Personal information such as your name or email address will not be shared with these. We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology. If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our Cookies Policy, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal data that we collect using these technologies. Choice and control We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information. It is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a NG-NJ® account, you can control your information in the following ways. Email and notification preferences When you are signed into your account, you can access your Settings by clicking on the three-dots-tab at the top right of the screen, and selecting Settings from the drop down menu. From the Notifications tab you can tell us: which email notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us; and which Activity Notifications (if any) you would like to receive from us. You can also turn off email notifications from the Notifications tab within your Settings. This will immediately disable all email notifications, other than essential account notifications such as important service updates, reports of copyright infringement and other essential information relating to your account and your use of the Platform. It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the link at the end of each email. You can add additional or alternative email addresses that you may wish us to use to communicate with you in your Account Settings tab. Sharing with other apps and networks The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your NG-NJ® account. If you sign up for NG-NJ® using your Facebook or Google+ account, your NG-NJ® account and your Facebook or Google+ account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds that you post, listen or favourite on NG-NJ®, will be shared with the connected Facebook or Google+ account. Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. Content you share with Google will be seen by the people from your Google+ circles when they visit your Google+ profile, make relevant Google searches, on Google-served ads, and the services selected in your Google account settings. If you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your Settings. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your NG-NJ® account to, any of these third party sites or applications. Sharing with other users NG-NJ® is a very social place, but if you would prefer to browse the Website anonymously, you can do so by checking the Anonymous Listening box in the Account tab within your Settings on the Website. By checking this box, other users will not be able to see the sounds that you listened to, but we will still have access to this information. If any of your sounds contain any personal data or any other information which you would not like to share, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page (click on the pencil icon in the waveform player for the relevant sounds). By setting your sounds to “private”, rather than “public”, you can limit who has access to your sounds. Sharing with app developers NG-NJ® has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Website. Customizing the Platform and personalized ads We may also use third party services using cookies or similar technologies showing you personalized ads on our behalf. Please see our Cookies Policy for how to opt-out of those. Please be aware that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see ads, which likely are not as appealing to you. Cookies Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy. Further information is available at http://aboutcookies.org. App preferences You can use the settings within your iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the NG-NJ® tab. With an Android device you need to open the NG-NJ® app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app. Further information is available in our Cookies Policy. Deleting your account You can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings on the Website at any time. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account. Even if you delete your NG-NJ® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines\\' caching processes are outside of NG-NJ’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform. Please note that deleting any NG-NJ® Apps, or any third party apps to which your NG-NJ® account is connected, will not delete your NG-NJ® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your NG-NJ® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app. Access to your data As described above, most of the personal data and other information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your NG-NJ® account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal data we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any personal data that we hold about you, please contact us at privacy@NG-NJ.com, or the address provided below. If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal data in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so. International data transfers NG-NJ is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. Children NG-NJ® is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such personal data, please notify us immediately at privacy@NG-NJ.com. Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that NG-NJ® users are always aware of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website. Questions? If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, want to suggest changes to this Privacy Policy or want to know, what information we store about you, please contact us by email at privacy@NG-NJ.com, or write to us at: NG-NJ Limited Rheinsberger Str. 76/77 10115 Berlin Germany Attention: Legal Department Don’t want to give us your information?

name=\\\"terms-content\\\">Welcome to NG-NJ, a service provided by NG-NJ Limited (“NG-NJ”, “we” “our”, or “us”). These Terms of Use govern your use of NG-NJ.com and m.NG-NJ.com (together, the “Website”), our mobile and desktop apps (our \\\"Apps\\\") and all related players, widgets, tools, applications, data, software, APIs (which may also be subject to separate API Terms of Use) and other services provided by NG-NJ (the “Services”). These Terms of Use, together with our Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy, Community Guidelines and any other terms specifically referred to in any of those documents, constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and NG-NJ in relation to your use of the Website, Apps and Services (together, the “Platform”). These Terms of Use are divided into the following sections: Acceptance of Terms of Use Basically, by using NG-NJ® you accept our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy and Community Guidelines and agree to abide by them. Changes to Terms of Use This section explains that our Terms of Use may change from time to time. Description of the Platform This provides a general description of the Platform, its features and functionality. Your NG-NJ Account This section explains your responsibilities should you choose to register for a NG-NJ® account.

Your Content This section deals with ownership of your content, and includes your agreement not to upload anything that infringes on anyone else’s rights.

Representations and Warranties This section includes important promises and guarantees that you give when uploading content to NG-NJ® - in particular, your promise that everything you upload and share is owned by you and won’t infringe anyone else’s rights. Liability for Content This section explains that NG-NJ is a hosting service and that its users are solely liable for material that they upload to NG-NJ®. Reporting Infringements This section explains how to notify us of any content on NG-NJ® that you believe infringes your copyright or any other intellectual property right, or that is unlawful, abusive, defamatory or otherwise contrary to our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines. You can find further information on reporting copyright infringement on our Copyright Information pages. Third Party Websites and Services Through NG-NJ® you may have access to other websites and services. This section explains that these are separate third party services that are not under the control of NG-NJ. Blocking and Removal of Content This section makes it clear that NG-NJ may block or remove content from the Platform. Repeat Infringers Users who repeatedly infringe third party rights or breach our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines risk having their NG-NJ® accounts suspended or terminated, as explained in this section. Disclaimer This section explains that NG-NJ® cannot give any guarantees that the Platform will always be available – sometimes even a platform as awesome as ours will have a few problems. Limitation of Liability This section explains some of those things that NG-NJ will not be liable for. Please make sure you read and understand this section. Indemnification If you use the Platform in a way that results in damage to us, you will need to take responsibility for that. Data Protection, Privacy and Cookies It is really important to us that you understand how we use your personal information. All information is collected, stored and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy, so please make sure that you read and understand that policy. Like most other websites, we also use cookies to help us analyze how people use NG-NJ, so that we can keep improving our service. Our use of cookies is explained in our Cookies Policy. Please note: if you choose not to disable cookies within your browser, you will be indicating your consent to our use of cookies as described in our Cookies Policy, so please make sure that you read the policy carefully. Meetups This section deals with NG-NJ® meetups and explains that these are not “official’ NG-NJ events, so we cannot be responsible for anything that happens at meetups. Competitions and Other Promotions This section deals with competitions, contests and sweepstakes on NG-NJ®. These are not run by NG-NJ, and therefore we cannot be responsible for them. If you want to run your own competition on NG-NJ, make sure you read and understand our Competition Terms. Use of NG-NJ Players and Widget This section includes a few restrictions on how you can use our players and widgets – basically, don’t try to use our players to create a new music or audio streaming service. Subscriptions and Gift Codes This section links you to information explaining how to purchase ”Pro” and “Pro Unlimited” plans and „NG-NJ Go“ subscriptions as well as gift codes and how you can cancel your purchases in certain circumstances. Changes to the Platform, Accounts and Pricing From time to time, we may need to make some changes to NG-NJ®. This section explains your rights in this situation. Termination This section explains how you can terminate your NG-NJ® account, and the grounds on which we can terminate your use of NG-NJ®. Assignment to Third Parties This section deals with NG-NJ’s right to transfer this agreement to someone else. Severability This is a standard legal provision, which says that any term that is not valid will be removed from the agreement without affecting the validity of the rest of the agreement. Entire Agreement Your use of NG-NJ® is governed by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy and Community Guidelines. Any changes need to be made in writing. Third Party Rights These Terms of Use apply to the relationship between you and NG-NJ only. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction All of our documents are generally governed by German law. Disclosures This section provides information about NG-NJ, including how to contact us.

Description of the Platform The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (“Content”), which will be stored by NG-NJ at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via the Website, Apps and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users. We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use that we may release for those specific services or features. Your NG-NJ Account You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to the Apps and certain Services is only available to registered users. As an example, our App, NG-NJ Pulse, enables registered users, who upload and make available their Content to other users, to receive instant feedback on their tracks, communicate with their listeners and manage their Content any time. When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. Your email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account, whether or not such activity was authorized by you. If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe that your account has been accessed by unauthorized third parties, you are advised to notify NG-NJ in writing, and should change your password at the earliest possible opportunity. We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations. You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination section below.

If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence. If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available here. Use of NG-NJ Players and Widget The Platform includes access to customizable players (“Players”), and an embeddable version of the NG-NJ waveform player (“Widget”) for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader. You may not, without the prior written consent of NG-NJ, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of NG-NJ, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that NG-NJ or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial. NG-NJ reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. Subscriptions and Gift Codes Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a “Pro” or “Pro Unlimited” plan (together, “Pro Accounts”) or to NG-NJ Go (Pro Accounts and NG-NJ Go are each referred to as a \\\"Subscrpition\\\"). The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes related to Pro Accounts is subject to additional terms, which you will find here. In addition, the purchase of subscriptions for NG-NJ Go is subject to additional terms, which you will find here. The Pro Account Terms and the NG-NJ Go Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations. The Pro Account Terms are applicable to Pro and Pro Unlimited Account users and the NG-NJ Go Terms are applicable to NG-NJ Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription. NG-NJ reserves the right to limit the availability of NG-NJ Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as may be determined by NG-NJ in its sole discretion from time to time. Changes to the Platform, Accounts and Pricing NG-NJ reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, NG-NJ shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance. You hereby agree that NG-NJ and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that NG-NJ may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories. NG-NJ may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where NG-NJ proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, NG-NJ will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your NG-NJ® account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription. Termination You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to NG-NJ at Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, or by deleting your account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Subscription, and terminate this Agreement before the end of such Subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your Subscription. NG-NJ may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections: Your Use of the Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence , and Your Representations and Warranties; (iii) NG-NJ elects at its discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by NG-NJ at its discretion. If you have a Subscription and your account is suspended or terminated by NG-NJ pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your account is terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of NG-NJ. Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by NG-NJ, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or information for a certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before terminating your account, as NG-NJ assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following any termination of your account. NG-NJ is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of data relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your account is active. If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account, deleting that app will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account page within your Settings on the Website.
